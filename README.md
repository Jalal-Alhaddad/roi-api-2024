# API Project

The project contains markdown files that provide detailed documentation about the API. These files are:

- [API Usage](/Documents/API%20Usage.md)
- [Understanding Fetch API](/Documents/Understanding%20Fetch%20API.md)

Additionally, HTML files are available for a more visually appealing representation of the documentation. You can access these files:

- [API calling sample](/Documents/index.html)
- [Simple fetch API call](/Documents/sample.html)

Feel free to explore the documentation to learn more about the API and its usage.
